### CI/CD & Automation

17. **Scenario:** A Jenkins build passes all tests but the deployed service fails health checks immediately. How do you debug?
18. **Scenario:** Your CI pipeline takes 45 minutes to run and the team wants it under 10 minutes. How do you optimize it?
19. **Scenario:** You need to deploy to dev, staging, and prod from a single pipeline with different environment configs. How do you design this?
20. **Scenario:** An Ansible playbook is idempotent on first run but causes service restarts on every subsequent run. Why could this be happening?

### Architecture

21. **Scenario:** Your monolithic application is being broken into microservices. How do you design the migration to avoid downtime and data loss?
22. **Scenario:** You need to run a batch job that processes 10 million records nightly. How do you architect this on AWS cost-efficiently?
23. **Scenario:** A client needs SOC 2 and GDPR compliance. What AWS controls and DevOps practices do you put in place?
24. **Scenario:** Your team is deploying to production 10 times a day. What guardrails do you add to maintain stability?
